# Maze Solver

This project is a maze solver developed as part of the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) Backend Developer course. Semi-guided by Boot.dev, it covers the fundamental concepts and steps required to build the application. As a part of the backend developer curriculum, it emphasizes algorithmic thinking, data structures, and core Python programming skills.

## The Goal
The goal is to generate a maze and solve it automatically using a pathfinding algorithm, with a simple animation to visually demonstrate the solving process.

Please note that some small errors or structural issues may be present due to the learning nature of the project. It is possible that the project will be revisited and refined in the future as improvements are made and new concepts are learned.
